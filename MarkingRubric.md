# Train Timetable Interview Problem - Marking Rubric

In general we're looking for signs of a test-driven approach, or at least that all the tests have been made to pass. The programming exercise of traversing a two-dimensional array is a relatively trivial one and use of a control loop, ideally a for, but also while() or do...while() could be employed.  How closely do the tests in code match those in [the README](README.md)?  Has [the README](README.md) been fully read, so that the hints, such as for the time functions, have been incorporated into the code, or a suitable equivalent used instead.

Specifically for assessing for different levels, we'd look for:

| Level | Qualities to look for |
|-------|-----------------------|
| SEII | Do all the tests pass?<br/>Has simple control structures (such as a <em>for</em> loop) been used to traverse the two-dimensional array?<br/>have in-built or library functions been used for data-time calculations?|
| SEIII |is it readable in terms of function and variable naming?<br/>pass are there any signs of refactoring?<br/>correct variable scoping, choosing constants over variables where appropriate|
| SEIV |has domain specific language been employed, such as identifying a thing that’s a __train__, given that you’re provided with a __route__ as a hint initially?<br/>has it been refactored to be completely object orientated or functional?|
| SSE | It also solves the Reiman Hypothesis |
| SEL | They shouldn't be doing coding tests |
| SEM+ | They shouldn't be let anywhere near a computer! |
